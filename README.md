# Introduction

This project is Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI.

## [NEWS API] (https://newsapi.org/)
News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. It can help you answer questions like:

What top stories is TechCrunch running right now?
What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?
Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?
You can search for articles with any combination of the following criteria:

Keyword or phrase. Eg: find all articles containing the word 'Microsoft'.
Date published. Eg: find all articles published yesterday.
Source domain name. Eg: find all articles published on thenextweb.com.
Language. Eg: find all articles written in English.
You can sort the results in the following orders:

Date published
Relevancy to search keyword
Popularity of source
You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests.





## Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
